Node.js implementation of proxy server 
- Support for SSL, authentication, upstream proxy chaining, custom HTTP responses and measuring traffic statistics
- Squid is harder to work with , it is a proxy server 
- Node JS replaces old proxy server (Squid)
- Needs to have authentication (user/pass)
- look into upstream vs not upstream
- get some details on it: throughput (speedtest.net and compare to workingvpn extension), multithreading, http2 


Can we use proxy chains to replace squid server setup? 
Does it perform as good as squid server? 
What does CPU usage look like under medium to heavy load compared to squid? 


Note to self: 
Mozilla only works when my proxy is up, otherwise it won't load any webpages at all
